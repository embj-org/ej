# EJ

EJ is a modular and scalable framework for automated testing on physical embedded boards.

It enables dispatching tests to real hardware, collecting logs and performance metrics, and detecting hardware-specific issues. EJ is designed to support diverse board architectures and simplify distributed hardware testing for embedded projects.

:construction: EJ is a work in progress. I'm actively developing the core infrastructure, and more documentation, setup guides, and examples will be added soon.
